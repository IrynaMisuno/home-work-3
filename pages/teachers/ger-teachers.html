      <h2>A friendly and experienced German teacher!</h2>

      <p>I'm Lars from Cologne, I have a great sense of humor and a passion for helping you learn German.</p>

      <p>
        As I also enjoy learning other languages, I can really understand all the challenges that come with learning a foreign language.
Why, for example, does Hungarian have so little connection to other languages?
      </p>
      <p>
        I have 12 years of teaching experience in Ukraine and 2 years in the USA.

      <h2>Learn 'Austrian' or 'High German' and become a confident speaker.</h2>

      <p>I am Germany language tutor with 4 years of experience</p>

      <p>
        My name is Uta. I am 26 years old and currently live in Tenerife.</p>
<p>I used to compete in alpine skiing until I was 21 years old, and I have therefore always been in contact with various people from all over the world. </p>
<p>That said, communication and storytelling in various languages have always been part of me.
