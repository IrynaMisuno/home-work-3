      <p>Hi friends, I'm María José, I'm from Mexico City and I'm your new Spanish tutor!</p>

      <h2>Connect with Spanish: Dynamic classes full of art, for all ages and all levels</h2>

      <p>Hi, I'm Nadia, and I have more than 5 years of experience teaching Spanish as a second language to foreign students.</p>
       <p> My methodology is direct, practical and unique: I integrate Spanish art in all its forms (music, cinema, literature) so that learning is dynamic and enriching.</p>

       <p> I like travelling, reading and doing yoga. I'm also interested in
        neurolinguistics and exploring new and efficient methods of teaching.</p>
